# Young Mathematicians Conference (YMC)

Hosted at The Ohio State University, August 15th - 17th.

## Day 0: August 14th

### Logistics

I left for the airport at 6:30 AM. Since my girlfriend Sherry also had a work trip starting today (with an 8:30 flight time), I wanted to make sure I could leave with her and see that she would arrive safely -- thus, the early wake up and travel time. After seeing Sherry go through the security checkpoint (for Southwest) relatively smoothly, I went over to concourse D to check into my flight, before then going through security as well (TSA Precheck made this process very easy). I had about three, four hours to kill, and I mainly texted friends, grabbed breakfast and later lunch from McDonalds, and listened to music. I took my first flight from BWI to DTW (Detroit), where I had another hour layover. This time, the flight from Detroit to Columbus, Ohio was overbooked, and so Delta ended up having to offer $1000 in gift cards to 7 passengers in exchange for them flying out on a later flight (my flight back from NCUR was similarly overbooked and a similar offer for $800 was made -- I think if I had been returning home rather than arriving at the conference, I would have taken this deal, especially since the flight from DTW to CMH is only an hour long). Soon enough, though, I was on the plane to Columbus and I arrived at around 5. 

After grabbing my luggage from baggage claim, I ordered an Uber to the Blackwell Hotel, a super nice 4 star hotel that the conference is providing for us. I unpacked a few things, charged my devices, and sent a message on the Discord to ask if anyone wanted to grab dinner. I also prepped my presentation some more, even going through a rough practice run with a friend from my UMD REU. Luckily, I got one taker and so I officially met my first conference participant (YJ, though I did meet someone else in the elevator) and we went to dinner at Diaspora, a Korean-Japanese fusion restaurant. 

After dinner, I walked back to the hotel (YJ went off to the math building), where I made some calls to parents and friends before relaxing for the night. The OSU campus is quite nice -- the hotel is also right next to a bunch of sports facilities including the football stadium -- so it should be fun to be both a conference attendee and an explorer in the next few days.
